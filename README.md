- 👋 Hi, I’m @bill-the-old-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in a little bit of everything. I go back to the first Apple //, and integer Basic. From there I moved around various computers and languages.
Today I'm mostly interested in interpreted languages such as Python and Micro Python/Circuit Python and Julia. For compiled languages it's C/C++, Go, and Rust.
I deal with other languages, such as JavaScript, only when necessary.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write in Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something small in those areas outlined above.
- 📫 You can reach me here.
